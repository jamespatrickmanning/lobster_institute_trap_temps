Since different techs worked with Rick over the years, the data came to us in different formats and often required a bit of back and forth to get all the metadata straight.
We needed to add sites to the emolt_site table (typically about a half dozen each year) which had "Rick" and "Wahle" in the first_name and last_name field and the fisher in the comments field.

There is also a "notes_wahle" google document that has JiM's notes on processing data each year at:
